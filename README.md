project-owl
===========

A Google App Engine web application that helps you out by logging stuff you need to remember and keeps you up
to date on your progress.

At the moment I'm not sure what the name of this application is going to be, so I'm leaving the repository name
under the project's code name, Project Owl.

I'm using this project mainly for learning purposes with programming, application design, cloud platforms,
Git, and more, so please excuse any newbie mistakes. I'm open to advice and critiques so contact me if you have
any!
